  <p><em>My name is Leila Zebarjadi, I am fifty three years old, mother of four grown up children, and I have more than twenty eight years of experience as an elementary school teacher and a child care provider. <br />
      In 2013 I opened up my child care, <strong>Blueberry Muffins FCC</strong> , which is dedicated to children 1 to 5 years of age. I feel that this age group needs education the most. My philosophy has grown out of my experience as a teacher and
      from my education. As a child care provider/teacher, I am actively involved in guiding, stimulating, and encouraging growth in young children. Through-out the years I have learned that childcares need to go beyond learning. Before a child can
      learn they must feel comfortable in a safe and healthy environment. When a child feels safe and healthy it positively fosters children’s social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development. I feel that a positive environment is needed in
      order for children to fully understand love, encouragement, and respect. Although it is important to teach them curriculum; we owe it to the children to understand them as an individual.</em></p>
